# University Graphics
University Graphics is a project which was orignal created for a university assigment but was worked on in my free time to help improvement my understanding of OpenGL, graphics programming and engine development.

# Features

## ECS
University Graphics uses an Entity-Component-System (ECS) for the foundations of the engine, this is what other engines like Unity or Unreal Engine use. The ECS systems allows for new components to be added with ease and aids in the flexibility of the engine.

## [OpenGL]( https://www.opengl.org)
Currently OpenGL is the only supported graphics API. Future are to implement Direct X and Vulkan.

## [ImGui]( https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) 
ImGui is used to handle the UI of the engine. ImGui is currently being used due to the ease of use and efficiency.

# Development Tools
## [Deleaker]( https://www.deleaker.com)
Deleaker is being used to help find memory issue within the code. This includes finding any memory leaks which may been within the engine. Deleaker can be found [here](https://www.deleaker.com). Deleaker helps us to find leaks.
