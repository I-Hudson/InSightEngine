# Insight
Insight is a lite engine which I have been working on in my free time to improvement my understanding of OpenGL, graphics programming and engine development. I am currently using this engine for education but hope to continue developing it.

# Features

## ECS
Insight uses an Entity-Component-System (ECS) for the foundations of the engine, this is what other engines like Unity or Unreal Engine use. The ECS systems allows for new components to be added with ease and aids in the flexibility of the engine.

## [OpenGL]( https://www.opengl.org)
Insight currently renders using OpenGL. Future are to implement Direct X and Vulkan.

## [ImGui]( https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) 
Insight uses ImGui to handle the UI of the engine. ImGui is currently being used due to the ease of use and efficiency.

# Development Tools
## [Deleaker]( https://www.deleaker.com)
Deleaker is being used to help find memory issue within the code. This includes finding any memory leaks which may been within the engine. Deleaker can be found [here](https://www.deleaker.com). Deleaker helps us to find leaks.
